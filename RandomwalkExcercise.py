# 15-4. Modified Random Walks: In the RandomWalk class, x_step and y_step are generated from the same set of conditions.
# The direction is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
# Modify the values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks.
# Try a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the âˆ’1 from the x or y direction list.
#
# x_direction = choice([1])
# x_distance = choice([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
# x_step = x_direction * x_distance
#
# y_direction = choice([1, -1])
# y_distance = choice([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
# y_step = y_direction * y_distance

# 15-5. Refactoring: The fill_walk() method is lengthy. Create a new method called get_step() to determine the direction
# and distance for each step, and then calculate the step.
# You should end up with two calls to get_step() in fill_walk(): x_step = self.get_step() y_step = self.get_step()
# This refactoring should reduce the size of fill_walk() and make the method easier to read and understand.

    # def fill_walk(self):
    #     """Calculate all the points in the walk."""
    #
    #     # Keep taking steps until the walk reaches the desired length.
